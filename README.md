# üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Data Pipeline

## Overview
This project analyzes historical weekly sales data in the retail domain, applying modern data engineering practices to build a cloud-native analytics pipeline. Raw data is ingested from AWS S3 into Snowflake, transformed using dbt into dimensional models (including an SCD2 fact table), and visualized through interactive dashboards in Python and Plotly.

This project demonstrates a modern data engineering workflow using:

- **AWS S3** for storage of raw CSV data
- **Snowflake** for cloud warehousing
- **dbt** for transformation into dimensional models (SCD2 fact + store/date dimensions)
- **Python + Plotly** for interactive reporting and visualization
