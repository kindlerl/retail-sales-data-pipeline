## üì¶ Walmart Sales Analytics Pipeline

This project analyzes historical weekly sales data for Walmart, applying modern data engineering practices to build a cloud-native analytics pipeline. The goal is to transform raw CSV data into dimensional models and deliver actionable insights through visual reporting.

This project demonstrates a modern data engineering workflow using:

- **AWS S3** for storage of raw CSV data
- **Snowflake** for cloud warehousing
- **dbt** for transformation into dimensional models (SCD2 fact + store/date dimensions)
- **Python + Plotly** for interactive reporting and visualization
